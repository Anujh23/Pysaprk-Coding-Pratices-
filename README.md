# Pysaprk-Coding-Pratices-

Optimized PySpark scripts & best practices for big data processing. Examples include:

1. **Importing Libraries:** Import or install libraries in a separate cell to avoid repetitive execution.
   ```python
   # Cell 1:
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   # Cell 2:
   # Further code


1. Importing libraries in a separate cell to avoid repetitive execution.
   
   # Importing libraries in a separate cell
   # Cell 1:
   # Imports
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   # Cell 2:
   # Further code

2. Storing data into Azure Blob for recovery capabilities.
   
   # Storing data into Azure Blob
   df.write.format("csv").save("wasbs://container@storage.blob.core.windows.net/path")

3. Converting data types for efficiency.

   # Convert data types for efficiency
   df = df.withColumn("int_column", df["int_column"].cast("int"))

4. Utilizing SparkSession for efficient use of DataFrame (df) and RDD.

   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

   # Create SparkSession
   spark = SparkSession.builder \
       .appName("example") \
       .getOrCreate()

   # Now use spark to create DataFrame and RDD

5. Ensuring consistent and proper indentation for code readability.

   # Proper indentation
   def my_function():
       for i in range(10):
           print(i)

6. Adhering to proper naming conventions.

   # Proper naming conventions
   def calculate_average(numbers_list):
       return sum(numbers_list) / len(numbers_list)

7. Defining global variables and functions effectively for reusability.

   # Define global variable
   global_var = 10

   # Define global function
   def global_function():
       print("Hello from global function!")

8. Implementing lazy evaluation to optimize performance.

   # Lazy evaluation
   df.filter(df["column"] > 10).select("column").show()

9. Maintaining clean and readable code for easy comprehension.

   # Clean and readable code
   def calculate_mean(numbers):
       total = sum(numbers)
       count = len(numbers)
       return total / count

10. Monitoring and optimizing resource utilization using Spark UI.

    # Spark UI for monitoring
    # Access Spark UI at http://localhost:4040/

11. Avoiding unnecessary data movement and transformations.

    # Avoid unnecessary transformations
    df_cached = df.cache()

12. Utilizing caching and persistence strategies.

    # Caching DataFrame
    df.cache()

13. Implementing proper data partitioning to enhance processing speed.

    # Data partitioning
    df_partitioned = df.repartition(10)

14. Adjusting data partitions for optimal processing performance.

    # Adjusting data partitions
    df_repartitioned = df.repartition(8)  # Adjusted to achieve 1GB partitions

15. Optimizing memory allocation based on project needs.

    # Driver memory allocation
    --driver-memory 4g

    # Executor memory allocation
    --executor-memory 8g

16. Utilizing broadcast variables to minimize data shuffling.

    # Using broadcast variables
    broadcast_var = spark.sparkContext.broadcast(small_df)

17. Utilizing proper broadcast techniques for efficient processing.

    # Broadcast join
    from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast

    joined_df = large_df.join(broadcast(small_df), "common_column")

18. Minimizing loop functions in favor of vectorization.

    # Vectorized operations
    df["result_column"] = df["column1"] * df["column2"]

19. Ensuring appropriate data partitioning through repartition and coalesce methods.

    # Repartitioning
    df_repartitioned = df.repartition(10)

    # Coalescing
    df_coalesced = df.coalesce(4)

20. Documenting code effectively for understanding and maintenance.

    # Documenting code
    """
    This function calculates the mean of a list of numbers.

    Parameters:
    numbers (list): List of numbers.

    Returns:
    float: Mean of the numbers.
    """
    def calculate_mean(numbers):
        total = sum(numbers)
        count = len(numbers)
        return total / count

21. Regularly reviewing and refactoring code for improvements.

    # Regular code review and refactoring
    # Periodically review and refactor code for improvements
