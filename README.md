# Pysaprk-Best-Coding-Pratices
Optimized PySpark scripts &amp; best practices for big data processing.

```
## 1. Separate Imports

Import or install libraries in a separate cell to avoid repetitive execution.

```python
# Cell 1: Imports
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Cell 2: Further code
```

## 2. Utilize Azure Blob Storage

For data storage, leverage Azure Blob storage due to its recovery capabilities.

```python
# Storing data into Azure Blob
df.write.format("csv").save("wasbs://container@storage.blob.core.windows.net/path")
```

## 3. Optimize Data Types

Choose appropriate data types for efficiency, like converting `int64` to `int32`.

```python
# Convert data types for efficiency
df = df.withColumn("int_column", df["int_column"].cast("int"))
```

## 4. Use SparkSession

Always utilize `SparkSession` for efficient use of DataFrame (df) and Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD).

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("example").getOrCreate()
```

## 5. Ensure Consistent Indentation

Proper indentation enhances code readability.

```python
def my_function():
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
```

## 6. Follow Naming Conventions

Adhere to proper naming conventions for variables, functions, and other identifiers.

```python
def calculate_average(numbers_list):
    return sum(numbers_list) / len(numbers_list)
```

## 7. Define Global Variables and Functions

Effectively define global variables and functions for reusability across the codebase.

```python
global_var = 10

def global_function():
    print("Hello from global function!")
```

## 8. Implement Lazy Evaluation

Optimize performance through lazy evaluation.

```python
df.filter(df["column"] > 10).select("column").show()
```

## 9. Maintain Clean Code

Keep your code clean and readable for easy comprehension.

```python
def calculate_mean(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    return total / count
```

## 10. Monitor Resource Utilization

Use Spark UI and monitoring tools for efficient cluster management.

```python
# Access Spark UI at http://localhost:4040/
```

## 11. Minimize Data Movement

Avoid unnecessary data movement and transformations for improved efficiency.

```python
df_cached = df.cache()
```

## 12. Utilize Caching and Persistence

Optimize repeated computations through caching and persistence strategies.

```python
df.cache()
```

## 13. Implement Data Partitioning

Enhance processing speed significantly via proper data partitioning.

```python
df_partitioned = df.repartition(10)
```

## 14. Adjust Data Partitions

Adjust data partitions for optimal processing performance.

```python
df_repartitioned = df.repartition(8)  # Adjusted to achieve 1GB partitions
```

## 15. Optimize Memory Allocation

Prioritize storage or processing power based on project needs.

```bash
--driver-memory 4g
--executor-memory 8g
```

## 16. Utilize Broadcast Variables

Minimize data shuffling with broadcast variables for small tables.

```python
broadcast_var = spark.sparkContext.broadcast(small_df)
```

## 17. Efficient Broadcast Techniques

Distribute processing load efficiently across nodes with proper broadcast techniques.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast

joined_df = large_df.join(broadcast(small_df), "common_column")
```

## 18. Prefer Vectorization Over Loops

Avoid redundant iterations by utilizing vectorized operations.

```python
df["result_column"] = df["column1"] * df["column2"]
```

## 19. Appropriate Data Partitioning

Use repartition and coalesce methods to meet specific requirements.

```python
df_repartitioned = df.repartition(10)
df_coalesced = df.coalesce(4)
```

## 20. Document Code Effectively

Include explanations of complex logic, algorithms, and assumptions.

```python
"""
This function calculates the mean of a list of numbers.

Parameters:
numbers (list): List of numbers.

Returns:
float: Mean of the numbers.
"""
def calculate_mean(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    return total / count
```

## 21. Regular Code Review and Refactoring

Periodically review and refactor code for improvements.

```python
# Regular code review and refactoring for better performance and maintainability
```

## 22. Utilize Logging for Debugging and Monitoring

Replace print statements with logging for better debugging, monitoring, and log management.

```python
import logging

# Set logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Example usage
def my_function():
    logging.info("Executing my_function...")
    # Your code here

# Call the function
my_function()
```

## 23. Handle Null Values Appropriately

Handle null values gracefully to prevent errors and ensure accurate processing.

```python
# Replace null values with a default or meaningful placeholder
df_filled = df.fillna(0)  # Replace null values with 0
```

## 24. Use Broadcast Join for Large Tables

Optimize join operations with large tables using broadcast joins.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast

# Perform a broadcast join for better performance with large tables
joined_df = large_df.join(broadcast(small_df), "common_column")
```

## 25. Limit Data for Development and Testing

Limit data size during development and testing to accelerate iterations.

```python
# Limit data for faster testing
sample_df = df.sample(fraction=0.1, seed=42)  # Sample 10% of the data
```

## 26. Handle Data Skewness

Handle data skewness to prevent performance bottlenecks.

```python
# Use techniques like bucketing to handle data skewness
df_bucketed = df.repartitionByRange(10, "column_name")
```

## 27. Optimize UDFs (User Defined Functions)

Optimize user-defined functions for better performance.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
from pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType

# Define and register UDF
@udf(returnType=IntegerType())
def my_udf_function(value):
    # Your logic here
    return processed_value

# Apply UDF to DataFrame
df_with_udf = df.withColumn("processed_column", my_udf_function(df["input_column"]))
```

## 28. Handle Timeouts and Retries

Handle timeouts and retries for resilient job execution.

```python
from pyspark.sql.utils import AnalysisException
import time

# Example with retries
retry_count = 3
retry_delay = 5  # in seconds

for _ in range(retry_count):
    try:
        # Your code here
        break  # If successful, break out of the loop
    except AnalysisException as e:
        logging.error(f"AnalysisException occurred: {e}. Retrying...")
        time.sleep(retry_delay)
```

## 29. Utilize Window Functions for Complex Aggregations

Use window functions for complex aggregations and analytics.

```python
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import row_number

# Example of row number calculation within a window
window_spec = Window.partitionBy("partition_column").orderBy("order_column")
df_with_row_number = df.withColumn("row_number", row_number().over(window_spec))
```

## 30. Experiment with Different Execution Plans

Experiment with different execution plans to find the most efficient one.

```python
# Example: Changing join strategies
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", -1)  # Disable automatic broadcast join
# Perform joins with different strategies and analyze performance
```

## Continuous Learning and Adaptation
